","An important challenge for understanding protoplanetary disks and planetary forma- tion is to be able to make a reliable connection between observed structures like bright and dark rings or asymmetries in radio emission observations provided by ALMA and the supposed presence of forming planets triggering these structures. Usually, the pres- ence of N dark rings that are observed in real disks is interpreted as the presence of N fixed planets which would each create an accumulation of dust near the local max- imum in the disk gas pressure. We show here that other configurations can explain these multiple rings. We use gas and dust hydrodynamical simulations with the 2D code FARGO to study the impact of the migration of a Saturn mass planet on the dust content of massive protoplanetary disks. When migration slows down, a pressure maximum forms beyond the plant that traps the large dust. We find a regime for which the planet migrates intermittently, with multiple runaway phases that lead to the formation of multiple sets of bright and dark rings beyond the planet’s location.",clement.baruteau@free.fr,Yes,,Mon,8:45 - 9:15,"January 31, 2015 6:30 PM",Stars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UgsqtaXiwI,

Our models unveil the critical role of vortices in determining the migration behaviour for partial gap-opening planets. Vortices form in pressure maxima at gap edges, and prevent the disc-feedback stopping of migration for intermediate planets in low-viscosity and inviscid discs, contrary to the concept of the ‘inertial limit’ or ‘disc feedback’ halting predicted from analytical models. Vortices may also form in the corotation region, and can dramatically modify migration behaviour through direct gravitational interaction with the planet. These features become apparent at high resolution, and for all but the highest viscosities there exist significant difficulties in obtaining numerically converged results. The migration of partial gap-opening planets, however, clearly becomes chaotic for sufficiently low viscosities. At moderate viscosity, a smooth disc-feedback regime is found in which migration can slow substantially, and the migration time-scale observed corresponds to migration being driven by diffusive relaxation of the gap edges. At high viscosity classical Type I migration is recovered. For Jupiter-analogue planets in inviscid discs, a wide, deep gap is formed. Transient Type II migration occurs over radial length-scales corresponding to the gap width, beyond which migration can stall. Finally, we examine the particle trapping driven by structures left in inviscid discs by a migrating planet, and find that particle traps in the form of multiple rings and vortices can persist long after the planet has passed. In this case, the observation of particle traps by submillimetre interferometers such as ALMA cannot be used to infer the current presence of an adjacent planet.

 ",Dust traps in the protoplanetary disc MWC 758: two vortices produced by two giant planets?,"Resolved ALMA and VLA observations indicate the existence of two dust traps in the protoplanetary disc MWC 758. By means of 2D gas+dust hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with 3D dust radiative transfer calculations, we show that the spirals in scattered light, the eccentric, asymmetric ring and the crescent-shaped structure in the (sub)millimetre can all be caused by two giant planets: a 1.5-Jupiter mass planet at 35 au (inside the spirals) and a 5-Jupiter mass planet at 140 au (outside the spirals). The outer planet forms a dust-trapping vortex at the inner edge of its gap (at 85 au), and the continuum emission of this dust trap reproduces the ALMA and VLA observations well. The outer planet triggers several spiral arms which are similar to those observed in polarised scattered light. The inner planet also forms a vortex at the outer edge of its gap (at 50 au), but it decays faster than the vortex induced by the outer planet, as a result of the disc’s turbulent viscosity. The vortex decay can explain the eccentric inner ring seen with ALMA as well as the low signal and larger azimuthal spread of this dust trap in VLA observations. Finding the thermal and kinematic signatures of both giant planets could verify the proposed scenario.",clement.baruteau@free.fr,Yes,,Wed,11:15 - 11:30,"January 31, 2015 6:32 PM",Disks,,http://clement.baruteau.free.fr/witgaf/Baruteau_WITGAF2019_online.pdf
4,contributed,Masanobu Kunitomo,Kurume University,Dispersal of protoplanetary disks by the combination of magnetically driven and photoevaporative winds ,"We investigate the roles of magnetically driven disk wind (MDW) and thermally driven photoevaporative wind (PEW) in the long-time evolution of protoplanetary disks. We start simulations from the early phase in which the disk mass is 0.118 Solar masses around a 1 $M_\star$ star and track the evolution until the disk is completely dispersed. We incorpo- rate the mass loss by PEW and the mass loss and magnetic braking (wind torque) by MDW, in addition to the viscous accretion, viscous heating, and stellar irradiation. We find that MDW and PEW respectively have different roles: magnetically driven wind ejects materials from an inner disk in the early phase, whereas photoevaporation has a dominant role in the late phase in the o 1 au) disk. The disk lifetime, which depends on the combination of MDW, PEW, and viscous accretion, shows a large variation of 120 Myr; the gas is dispersed mainly by the MDW and the PEW in the cases with a low viscosity and the lifetime is sensitive to the mass-loss rate and torque of the MDW, whereas the lifetime is insensitive to these parameters when the viscosity is high. Even in disks with very weak turbulence, the cooperation of MDW and PEW enables the disk dispersal within a few Myr.",clement.baruteau@free.fr,Yes,,Thu,14:30 - 15:15,"January 31, 2015 6:33 PM",Stars,,
5,poster,R. Murray-Clay for the UCSC team,University of California at Berkeley,A signature of planetary migration: the origin of the $2:1$ mean-motion resonance,"The spatial distribution of Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) in 2:1 exterior resonance with Neptune constrains that planet’s migration history. Numerical simulations demonstrate that fast planetary migration generates a larger population of KBOs trailing rather than leading Neptune in orbital longitude. This asymmetry corresponds to a greater proportion of objects caught into asymmetric resonance such that their resonance angless librate about values greater than (trailing) as opposed to less than (leading). We provide, for the first time, an explanation of this phenomenon, using physical, analytic, and semianalytic arguments.",clement.baruteau@free.fr,Yes,,Fri,16:30 - 16:45,"January 31, 2015 6:34 PM",Planets,,
