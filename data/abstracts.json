Usually, the presence of N dark rings that are observed in real disks is interpreted as the presence of N fixed planets which would each create an accumulation of dust near the local maximum in the disk gas pressure. We show here that other configurations can explain these multiple rings. We use gas and dust hydrodynamical simulations with the 2D code FARGO to study the impact of the migration of a Saturn mass planet on the dust content of massive protoplanetary disks. When migration slows down, a pressure maximum forms beyond the plant that traps the large dust. We find a regime for which the planet migrates intermittently, with multiple runaway phases that lead to the formation of multiple sets of bright and dark rings beyond the planet\u2019s location.</p>", "title": "Intermittent planet migration and the formation of multiple dust rings in protoplanetary disks", "authoremail": "<a href='mailto:piou@gmail.com'>piou@gmail.com</a>", "link": "--", "loctime": "TBA, time to be announced", "index": 0.0}, {"type": "contributed talk", "author": "Cl\u00e9ment Baruteau", "authorlist": "Cl\u00e9ment Baruteau; Marcelo Barraza; Sebasti\u00e1n P\u00e9rez; Simon Casassus; Ruobing Dong; Wladimir Lyra; Sebasti\u00e1n Marino; Valentin Christiaens; Zhaohuan Zhu; Andr\u00e9s Carmona; Florian Debras; Felipe Alarcon", "affiliations": "(1) IRAP, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse; (2)  Universidad de Chile & Max Planck Institute for Astronomy; (3)  Universidad de Chile; (4)  Universidad de Chile; (5)  University of Arizona; (6)  California State University Northridge & Jet Propulsion Laboratory; (7)  Max Planck Institute for Astronomy; (8)  Universidad de Chile & Monash Centre for Astrophysics; (9)  University of Nevada; (10)  IRAP, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse; (11)  IRAP, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse; (12)  Universidad de Chile", "abstract": "<p class=\"abstract\">Resolved ALMA and VLA observations indicate the existence of two dust traps in the protoplanetary disc MWC 758. By means of 2D gas+dust hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with 3D dust radiative transfer calculations, we show that the spirals in scattered light, the eccentric, asymmetric ring and the crescent-shaped structure in the (sub)millimetre can all be caused by two giant planets: a 1.5-Jupiter mass planet at 35 au (inside the spirals) and a 5-Jupiter mass planet at 140 au (outside the spirals). The outer planet forms a dust-trapping vortex at the inner edge of its gap (at 85 au), and the continuum emission of this dust trap reproduces the ALMA and VLA observations well. The outer planet triggers several spiral arms which are similar to those observed in polarised scattered light. The inner planet also forms a vortex at the outer edge of its gap (at 50 au), but it decays faster than the vortex induced by the outer planet, as a result of the disc\u2019s turbulent viscosity. The vortex decay can explain the eccentric inner ring seen with ALMA as well as the low signal and larger azimuthal spread of this dust trap in VLA observations. Finding the thermal and kinematic signatures of both giant planets could verify the proposed scenario.</p>", "title": "Dust traps in the protoplanetary disc MWC 758: two vortices produced by two giant planets?", "authoremail": "<a href='mailto:clement.baruteau@gmail.com'>clement.baruteau@gmail.com</a>", "link": "--", "loctime": "TBA, time to be announced", "index": 1.0}, {"type": "contributed talk", "author": "Colin P.

Our models unveil the critical role of vortices in determining the migration behaviour for partial gap-opening planets. Vortices form in pressure maxima at gap edges, and prevent the disc-feedback stopping of migration for intermediate planets in low-viscosity and inviscid discs, contrary to the concept of the \u2018inertial limit\u2019 or \u2018disc feedback\u2019 halting predicted from analytical models. Vortices may also form in the corotation region, and can dramatically modify migration behaviour through direct gravitational interaction with the planet. These features become apparent at high resolution, and for all but the highest viscosities there exist significant difficulties in obtaining numerically converged results. The migration of partial gap-opening planets, however, clearly becomes chaotic for sufficiently low viscosities. At moderate viscosity, a smooth disc-feedback regime is found in which migration can slow substantially, and the migration time-scale observed corresponds to migration being driven by diffusive relaxation of the gap edges. At high viscosity classical Type I migration is recovered. For Jupiter-analogue planets in inviscid discs, a wide, deep gap is formed. Transient Type II migration occurs over radial length-scales corresponding to the gap width, beyond which migration can stall. Finally, we examine the particle trapping driven by structures left in inviscid discs by a migrating planet, and find that particle traps in the form of multiple rings and vortices can persist long after the planet has passed. In this case, the observation of particle traps by submillimetre interferometers such as ALMA cannot be used to infer the current presence of an adjacent planet. </p>", "title": "Migrating super-Earths in low-viscosity discs: unveiling the roles of feedback, vortices, and laminar accretion flows", "authoremail": "<a href='mailto:rrr@uc.uk'>rrr@uc.uk</a>", "link": "--", "loctime": "TBA, time to be announced", "index": 2.0}, {"type": "contributed talk", "author": "M.

We start simulations from the early phase in which the disk mass is 0.118 Solar masses around a 1 $M_\\star$ star and track the evolution until the disk is completely dispersed. We incorpo- rate the mass loss by PEW and the mass loss and magnetic braking (wind torque) by MDW, in addition to the viscous accretion, viscous heating, and stellar irradiation.

The disk lifetime, which depends on the combination of MDW, PEW, and viscous accretion, shows a large variation of 120 Myr; the gas is dispersed mainly by the MDW and the PEW in the cases with a low viscosity and the lifetime is sensitive to the mass-loss rate and torque of the MDW, whereas the lifetime is insensitive to these parameters when the viscosity is high. Even in disks with very weak turbulence, the cooperation of MDW and PEW enables the disk dispersal within a few Myr.</p>", "title": "Dispersal of protoplanetary disks by the combination of magnetically driven and photoevaporative winds", "authoremail": "<a href='mailto:raou@p3e.gr'>raou@p3e.gr</a>", "link": "--", "loctime": "TBA, time to be announced", "index": 3.0}, {"type": "poster", "author": "R.

These emission rings are often lopsided, most notably in so-called transition discs. Despite limited observational evidence, these lopsided rings are so far best explained by dust trapping in a large-scale vortex in the gas. We investigate the observable consequences in the radio continuum of dust trapping in a vortex formed at the outer edge of the gap carved by a massive planet in its protoplanetary disc. From the spatial distribution of solid particles obtained in two-fluid 2D hydrodynamical simulations, we produce synthetic maps of the dust\u2019s continuum emission at various wavelengths in the (sub)- mm. A range of disc masses is adopted to examine how gas self-gravity impacts the concentration and emission of solid particles trapped in the vortex. At large gas den- sities at the vortex\u2019s radiaxl location (local background Toomre parameter is a few), gas self-gravity implies that several vortices form that merge and split intermittently. It makes the vortex long-lived and the dust emission forms a large-scale lopsided ring with possibly multiple peaks. Reducing the gas density leads to the formation of a single vortex with a much shorter lifetime. Before the vortex decays, the dust emission is confined to a rather narrow ring along which the flux contrast ratio is large. For moderate gas densities, the emission ring peaks at the vortex\u2019s centre from sub-mm to mm wavelengths, and the azimuthal contrast ratio increases with wavelength. For small gas densities, the emission peak shifts from the vortex\u2019s centre to about 90 de- grees ahead of the latter from sub-mm to mm wavelengths. As the vortex decays, solid particles lose their azimuthal trapping over different timescales depending on their size. This largely reduces the flux contrast ratio along the ring, which can decrease with wavelength.</p>", "title": "Cold dust emission from large-scale vortices induced by gap-opening planets", "authoremail": "<a href='mailto:c@d.com'>c@d.com</a>", "link": "--", "loctime": "poster number: 5.0", "index": 5.0}, {"type": "contributed talk", "author": "Pascal Petit", "authorlist": "Pascal Petit; Tianqi Cang; Pierre Kervella", "affiliations": "(1) IRAP, CNRS, Univ.

To analyze and interpret WISPR observations which evolve rapidly both radially and longitudinally, we construct a latitude versus time map using full WISPR dataset from the first encounter. From the exploitation of this map and also from sequential WISPR images we show the presence of multiple sub-structures inside streamers and pseudo-streamers. WISPR unveils the fine-scale structure of the densest part of streamer rays that we identify as the solar origin of the heliospheric plasma sheet typically measured in situ in the solar wind. We exploit 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models and we construct synthetic white-light images to study the origin of the coronal structures observed by WISPR. Overall, including the effect of the spacecraft relative motion towards the individual coronal structures we can interpret several observed features by WISPR. Moreover, we relate some coronal rays to folds in the heliospheric current sheet that are unresolved from 1 AU. Other rays appear to form as a result of the inherently inhomogeneous distribution of open magnetic flux tubes.

They can be used as a self-consistent framework to validate both the sources of the solar wind plasma measured in situ by PSP and a given theory of the solar wind birth and acceleration. Over the past decade, several Alfv\u00e9n wave turbulence driven MHD models have been developed for this purpose with varying levels of complexity. We present here such a model which, using fairly simple assumptions on the wave energy propagation and dissipation, has shown to be able to reproduce most of PSP in situ large scale measurements. We show that in addition to the wind speed, density and magnetic field polarity, the amplitude of the perturbations is well recovered. This suggests that switchbacks, which have been observed to be a significant part of the magnetic field perturbations in the first PSP encounters, are fully part of the solar wind turbulence. Our model fails however to explain the peak tangential velocities observed close to the Sun, showing that some dynamics is missing. One possible explanation is the combined effect of the observed highly non linear Alfv\u00e9nic switchbacks and pressure anisotropies on the angular momentum. We explore this hypothesis through analytical developments. \n</p>", "title": "What can we learn from global MHD modeling of PSP encounters?
