  <h2><span>Cool Stars 20 proceedings<span></h2>
  <div class="c12 row">
    <p><a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/cs20/"
      target="_blank">Proceedings for Cool Stars 20</a> will be
      entirely electronic and freely available online. A collection of
      participant contributions is made available
      through <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>, an EU funded
      data and project repository. All submissions must therefore be
      made on Zenodo's webpage.  To facilitate accessibilty and
      visibility, all contributions to the proceedings will indexed on
      the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/">ADS</a>.
      <br/><br/>
      Briefly, all submissions are assigned a Digital
      Object Identifier (DOI) number by Zenodo,
       <a href="https://zenodo.org/features">making contributions
       citeable</a>. Once all contributions are received, ADS will be
       notified, they will scrape the Zenodo collection, and then ADS
       will index each of the contributions as part of a larger volume
       (Proceedings for Cool Stars 20).  To ensure that all entries
       are properly indexed, it is vital that each contribution
       include appropriate metadata. In the tutorial below, you'll be
       instructed about which metadata to include in your submission.
       <br/><br/>
       Submission to
       the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> in parallel with
       submission to the conference proceedings is
       encouraged. However, if you submit to the arXiv, you must make
       sure to update the metadata in your Zenodo collection properly
       so that it does not get listed twice in ADS.
         </p>
    <br/>
    
        <h2><span>Types of contributions</span></h2>
	<div class="c12 row">
          <p> Contributions are accepted from invited plenary session
	    reviews, contributed plenary session talks and
	    splinter session talks, and contributed posters. In
	    addition, collective contributions from (parallel)
	    splinter sessions and contributions from the CS20 hack
	    day are welcome. If you would like to submit a typical
	    conference proceeding, there are no formal page
	    limits. However for some guidance, we recommend you
	    limit yourself to 4-8 pages for contributed talks and
	    10-15 pages for invited talks. Those wishing to submit
	    a written conference proceeding are encouraged to
	    format the document using the <a href="docs/proceedings_template.tar.gz">Cool Stars 20
	      LaTeX document class</a>. All such submissions should be made as PDFs and will be reviewed for content by the SOC and we may suggest edits.
	  </p>
	  <p> Submission of presentation slides from speakers and full posters are also encouraged. PDF versions of these documents are the preferred format for Zenodo contributions to permit the documents to be previewed in a web browser. For maximum impact, you can submit both, a written contribution and your presentation slides and/or a poster to provide greater context. Contributions will be checked for the proper metadata.</p>

	<h2><span>How to submit your contribution<span></h2>
	<div class="c12 row">
            <p>Submitting to Zenodo is rather simple, but it's important that all metadata be
            properly included so that articles get properly indexed on ADS. Below is a series
            of screenshots taking you through the submission process from start to finish.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 01:</strong> following the <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/cs20/" target="_blank"</a>link
            to the submission page for Cool Stars 20</a>. Click on the
			green "New upload" button on the right side of
			the screen. 
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 02:</strong> you'll be presented with a login screen:
            </p>
			<img src="images/login.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>If you have a Zenodo account, proceed to login. If you do not, you may login
            using your GitHub or ORCID account, or you may create a new account using the "Sign Up"
            button located at the bottom of the frame.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 03:</strong> Once you login, you'll be presented with an "Upload" screen:
            </p>
			<img src="images/upload.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Click the button to choose a
            file on your local machine, or drag and drop a file
			directly onto the screen. 
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 04:</strong> After you select a file where you will be
            able to fill out a wide variety of file metadata on the
			boxes below the upload box. Be sure that in
			the "Communities" box you see "The 20th
			Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar
			Systems, and the Sun". If you do not see this,
			start typing it into the search bar and it
			will automatically pop up. 
            </p>
			<img src="images/communities.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Now, start filling out information about your document. First, select the type of file you have
            just uploaded. <i>Ignore the DOI field, Zenodo will take care of this for you, unless you know
            for a fact that the document you're upload already has an assigned DOI. If you are unsure,
            then it likely does not already have a DOI.</i> Enter today's date for the publication date, if
            it's not automatically done for you. Enter the title of your article/poster/talk.
            <br/><br/>
            Enter the name of each author and their affiliation. <strong>NOTE</strong> names should be formatted
            as "Family Name, First name". 
            </p>
			<img src="images/metadata.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>You will be asked to fix this if you do not do it correctly the first time.
            It's important for ADS that this be done properly. Continue to fill in the requeted
            information, including the Description (i.e., Abstract), various keywords if you'd like
            to add keywords, and other notes you feel are important for the contribution (e.g., Poster
            number, or a name of a splinter session the contribution if affiliated with.)
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 07:</strong> Choose access rights and a license for your work. You are
            strongly encouraged to select Open Access and a permissive license so that people
            can easily access your work.
            </p>
			<img src="images/license.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 08-a:</strong> Optionally, you may specify funding information.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 08-b:</strong> If you submitted to the arXiv and/or your aricle was already indexed
            to ADS, add the related identifying information so that Zenodo and ADS will link all of the
            contributions into one neat little package.
            </p>
			<img src="images/ADSlink.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>
            <strong>Step 09:</strong> Open the "Contributors" section by clicking on it. Add Scott Wolk as an editor. Again, note that the name must
            be "Scott Wolk". Select Editor from the dropdown menu.
            </p>
			<img src="images/contributors.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>
            <strong>Step 10:</strong> Given credit where credit is due! If you referenced various works
            in your article, talk, or poster, give them credit by adding the reference information (yes,
            citations will be counted on ADS, but ADS will only know about them if you enter the
            information in the "References" section). See the image below about how to format the references:
            </p>
			<img src="images/references.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>This is basically a copy-paste of a bibliography.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Step 11:</strong> Fill out information about the Workshop as shown below:
            </p>
			<img src="images/conference.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>
            <strong>Step 12:</strong> Review the information to make sure you've done everything
            properly and then click "Publish"! Or, if you'd like save it
			and publish later, click "Save"
            </p>
			<img src="images/publish.png" width="100%">
            <br/><br/>
            <p>
            <strong>Step DONE:</strong> Congratulate yourself on a job well done.
            </p>
