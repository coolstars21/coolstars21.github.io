  <h2><span>Splinter sessions</span></h2>
<div class="c12 row">
  <p>Splinter sessions are going to be held on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday afternoon (we have not yet decided which session will take place on which day). There will be three splinter sessions in paralell. These sessions are organized separately from the main conference. Each splinter session will have its own website with contact information for contributors. The websites will be linked from the splinter session title in the list below when they are available.
  <strong>Splinter session organizers can set their own deadlines for contributions to their sessions.  Typically the deadlines will be in May.</strong>

	 <p>The CHARA Array is a six-telescope optical interferometer that
	 can resolve stellar diameters and details at the submilliarcsecond
	 level.  The Array is now available to guest observers for 50 nights
	 each year through the NOAO proposal process.  Please join us
	 and learn what the Array can do for you!</p>

      <h2><span>For reference: Splinter session proposals</span></h2>
      <div class="c12 row">

	<p>Splinter sessions were solicited from the community in January 2020. This process is now closed, but the original solicitation can be found below for reference.</p>
	
	<p>The CS21 SOC invites the community to propose splinter sessions on current hot topics. Proposals for splinter sessions can be made by individuals or groups of individuals. At this time, we are planning on 9 splinter sessions of 180 minutes each to be accommodated in our schedule. The splinter organizers will have access to abstracts of potential contributions submitted on the abstract form.</p>

	<p>Splinter organizers should be prepared to produce and maintain a website that includes the schedule and speakers, and describes opportunities for people to participate in the session. The splinter websites will be linked from the main CS21 website, so all meeting participants are aware of the splinter sessions and can make informed choices about which sessions they wish to attend. A complete program for each splinter should be online six weeks prior to the meeting, that is by May 8th, 2020 - and hopefully earlier.</p>

	<p>Any splinter session proposal should include the following:<p/>

	<ol>
	  <li>Title</li>
	  <li>Names of the session organizers with primary contact information; names of co-organizers if appropriate</li>
	  <li>Two page summary of the goal of the session, including discussion on why this is a timely and relevant topic for CS21</li>
	  <li>List of potential speakers, and a plan for how additional speakers will be solicited (Note that CS21 follows a "one person - one talk" rule. Plenary speakers cannot give a talk in a splinter session, nor can one person talk in more than one splinters session.)</li>
	  <li>Proposed Splinter format that includes a description on how the audience will be involved</li>
	  <li>Commitment to set up a website in support of the splinter, with a complete program online by May 8th, 2020</li>
	  <li>Commitment to contribute a summary of the session for the proceedings</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Deadline for splinter session proposals is <strong>December 9, 2019</strong>. Please submit proposals by mailing a plain text file to <a href="mailto:cs21@irap.omp.eu?subject=Splinter%20Session%20Proposal" target="_top">cs21@irap.omp.eu</a> with the subject line 'Splinter Session Proposal'.</p>

	<p>We plan to announce accepted splinter sessions by January, 15th
	2020, and will provide links to your splinter session website for
	attendees to submit contributions to your splinter as soon as
	possible.</p>

	<p>Please do not propose splinters that are too similar to the 5
	main morning sessions (see the conference <a href="https://coolstars21.github.io/program.html">program</a>) if you wish to maximise your chances of success.</p>
