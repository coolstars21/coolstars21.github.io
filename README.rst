Instructions for abstracts
==========================

Abstracts are submitted on a Google web form.
We need to format this for convenient reading in 2.5 cases:

1) Display initally, raw, submitted data
   a) for the SOC to review abstracts and select talks
   b) to pass on abstracts that were not selected to splinter session organizers
2) To diplay accepted abstracts on the website.

In 2) we will have a few additional columns of data (date and time for talks,
poster number for posters) but otherwise these formats can use the same formatting mechanism. We can just set a default for these columns to "not yet assigned" and then use the exact same columns.

In 1) we will distribute only talks to the SOC, as pure poster abstracts are still submitted at a later date.
