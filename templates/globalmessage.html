	 <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
 
	 <p>We regret to announce that the Cool Stars, Stellar Systems, and the Sun 21st Conference, originally planned to be held on June 22-26, 2020, in Toulouse, France, has to be postponed due to the current Covid-19 pandemic. The decision was discussed within the SOC and LOC, and agreed by all members of the organizing committees. We plan to reschedule CS21 in Summer 2021.</p>
 
	 <p>Preliminary dates (tbc) for CS21 would be 5-9 July 2021, at the same location in Toulouse, France. We foresee that the program that was designed for CS21 this year, including the planned invited talks and the scheduled splinter sessions, will still be largely relevant next year, unless other hot topics emerge till then. We will continue to provide updated information on the current CS21 website.</p>
 
	 <p>As chairs of the SOC and LOC, we would like to express our gratitude to all the members of the organizing committees, especially to the members of the LOC for the efforts they deployed in this uncertain context. We extend our thanks to the chairs of the proposed Splinter sessions, to the speakers who accepted our invitation for the plenary sessions, and to all of you who had registered for the conference.</p> 
 
	 <p>Take care, and we hope to see you next year!</p>
 
	 <p>S. Brun, J. Bouvier, P. Petit</p>

	 <p><strong><big><span style="color: #c95c50;"> Warning!</span> Several SOC members of splinters
 	 have received fraudulent phone calls proposing to book
 	 flights and hotels. They pretend to work with the organisers
 	 of CS21, which is not the case. It is likely that
 	 they got your name and institute from this website, and
 	 expect to get your credit card details. We recommend to be
 	 extremely careful, and to not provide any personal details to them!

	 <p><strong><big><span style="color: #c95c50;"> CORONAVIRUS INFORMATION:</span></big></strong></p>

	 <p><strong><big>The organizers are monitoring daily the
	 evolution of coronavirus worldwide and how this may affect
	 international travel and large meetings. At the moment, most
	 effective travel bans do not have a known duration and may be
	 lifted before the date of the CS21 conference and as of today
	 (March 11th) we have not been asked by the French government
	 or the organizing Research institutes to cancel/postpone the
	 conference. As a consequence, CS21 is still scheduled to be
	 held as planned on the week of 22nd of June
	 2020.</big></strong></p>

	 <p><strong><big>We, therefore, encourage everyone to submit
	 abstracts and register. Any registration will be 100%
	 refunded if (a) the meeting has to be cancelled or (b) if you
	 decide to cancel your participation less than 60 days after
	 your registration.</big></strong></p>
