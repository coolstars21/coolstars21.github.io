	 <p><strong><big>CORONAVIRUS INFORMATION:</big></strong></p>

	 <p><strong><big>The organizers are monitoring daily the
	 evolution of coronavirus worldwide and how this may affect
	 international travel and large meetings. At the moment, most
	 effective travel bans do not have a known duration and may be
	 lifted before the date of the CS21 conference and as of today
	 (March 11th) we have not been asked by the French government
	 or the organizing Research institutes to cancel/postpone the
	 conference. As a consequence, CS21 is still scheduled to be
	 held as planned on the week of 22nd of June
	 2020.</big></strong></p>

	 <p><strong><big>We, therefore, encourage everyone to submit
	 abstracts and register. Any registration will be 100%
	 refunded if (a) the meeting has to be cancelled or (b) if you
	 decide to cancel your participation less than 60 days after
	 your registration.</big></strong></p>
